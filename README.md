# StopDotZipDotMovURLs
A very simple filter list that blocks ALL extensions with .zip and .mov

This will prevent all .zip and .mov extensions from loading, as they should be. Thanks Google for this *very* secure decision :P

To install this you will want to copy this URL: and paste it into your favourite content blockers filter list! Personally I believe uBlock Origin to be the best one, but anything with configurable filter lists should work
